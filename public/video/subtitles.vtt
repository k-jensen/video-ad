Samuels: I do think that the Olmstead decision ushered in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.610 position:97%
a new understanding of the damage done to people with disabilities

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.670 position:78%
by placing them in these segregated settings.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.930 position:97%
And that was something that, I think, people hadn't focused on previously.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.110 position:61%
Since that time, we've really seen

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.290 position:97%
a growth in level of attention and certainly at the Justice Department

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.470 position:77%
it is a high priority of ours to ensure that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.620 position:98%
we enforce the dictates of Olmstead to the maximum extent.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.710

and Fridays at the Animal Protective Association.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520 position:97%
Shelter Worker: Typically when she shows up, she'll either be doing just a customary

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.150 position:98%
sort of shredding, some clerical work, some moving things around.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.930 position:97%
Her most important task is that she spends a lot of time in our cat room socializing cats.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.010 position:92%
Mallori: Oh my God! Total lap kitty. My kind of kitty!

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.090 position:75%
I love animals. They're loving and playful.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.120 position:97%
Shelter Worker: She shows up, she's happy to see everybody.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.130 position:95%
She's willing to do just about anything you'll give her.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.440 position:97%
If it's something she finds challenging, she'll still try and do it.

Lynn Seagle: I met Lucinda in a large institution in Lynchburg.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.460 position:97%
And I'm not even sure if she ever really had an official diagnosis

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.640 position:98%
of a developmental disability. Although she was raised by deaf parents.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.820 position:97%
And when I first saw her there, she looked at me and she said: "Can I go... with you?"

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.000 position:98%
She now lives in her own apartment right next door to her best friend, Charlotte.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.170 position:80%
Avid gardener. Delightful... delightful woman.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.340 position:97%
I can't imagine that she would have spent her days... in that institution.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.510
(music)

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.520 position:97%
Narrator: Robin had to leave her home when her physical condition became

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.530
too much to manage.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.660 position:98%
She moved to a nursing home but it wasn't where she wanted to live.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.830 position:88%
Robin: I have mental illness and emotional illness.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.010 position:97%
When I was in the nursing home, a day never went by that I wouldn't quit crying.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.180 position:81%
Because it is, I'm sorry, It's just depressing.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.350 position:97%
Because you just think... nursing home is the final step in your life. You know?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.520 position:98%
Home Health Aide: To see somebody, like Robin, who has already been

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.710 position:97%
in the nursing home and then to help her get home, which was her desire,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.750 position:64%
and to see how well she's doing now.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.940
She's got her nails painted.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.630 position:81%
She just seems like a very happy, healthy lady.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.650
Robin: Yeah.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.490 position:94%
Robin: That's just another reason it's nice to be home.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.680 position:66%
Because I love my flowers and plants.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.800
(music)

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.830 position:89%
Arlene Korab: The fact that soldiers are coming back

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.870 position:97%
with severe brain injuries. And they have been misdiagnosed as well.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.920 position:98%
It's very hard to tell the difference between a brain injury and post-traumatic stress syndrome.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.100 position:98%
But once it is diagnosed and they have realized what the difference is,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.280 position:97%
they're telling us 60% of all the veterans coming back with injuries

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.460 position:97%
have some form of brain injury and sent back to their communities.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.590 position:97%
Where they're going home, and their families are saying "What is wrong here? What's going on?"

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.670 position:97%
But once they're in the community, there are community-based services that they're going to

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.690 position:98%
need and they don't know what those services are. Many people don't realize

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.050 position:97%
that they are eligible for things like Social Security and Medicaid.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.240 position:97%
They just don't know that because they've never been in that position and they're living

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.420 position:97%
without income. There are some things in life that we all need. We all need friends.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.590 position:97%
We all need a place to go. We all need something to do with our day.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.760

Chase: Hi. My name is Chase Thorenson. I've been living on my own for two years.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.130 position:81%
I came from a rehabilitation center not knowing

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.200 position:97%
that I could receive the same services I do now living in my own home.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.270 position:92%
My life is good because I can come and go as I please.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.450
I have two jobs.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.630 position:97%
And lastly I want you guys to know that I am living my dream.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.810

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.990 position:98%
Eve Hill: The history of these programs, segregated progams were seen as the model.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.160 position:98%
And as the only thing people with disabilities would be capable of.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.350 position:91%
That change has happened over time. And more and more

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.530 position:97%
research and expertise and policies and models have come up

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.530 position:98%
that show that we know better now. That that is not the model.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:49.650
